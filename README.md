Assignment 1 for FED

The purpose of this website is to help new or returning players to learn the Yu-Gi-Oh! deck known as P.U.N.K.
It is meant to centralise all the information from across the internet from the different formats; Master Duel, TCG, and OCG.
This project uses javascript for drop down menu buttons in order to make it easier to navigate the site. It uses a CSS external style sheet in order to properly format the images and text on the website.

I referenced https://www.galaxy-eyes.de/guide.html and https://www.masterduelmeta.com/articles/guides/punk-royal-smug/ for the layout and some content of the website. 
I used https://www.duelingbook.com/ to record replays and YGO Omega for images. www.masterduelmeta.com and ygoprodeck.com had additional images I needed. Higher res images from tumblr and deviantart was used.
